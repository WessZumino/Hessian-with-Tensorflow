# Hessian-with-Tensorflow
A tutorial style explanation of how to evaluate the exact Hessian in Deep Learning using Autograd and Tensorflow

I looked for this for a while but did not find a convincing implementation. As I needed to study the eigenspectrum for a project, I decided to share this little piece of code with everyone in the tutorial form of a Jupyter notebook. 

Admittedly, the Hessian evaluation can be further optimized, but did not have time to implement this yet. I will update the code asap.
